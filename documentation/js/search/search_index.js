Smart Node - Angular SDK\nWelcome to Hsuite Angular SDK!\nThis library is meant to provide an easy-to-use interface to interact with our Smart Node Network, and to integrate our features into your own DAPP.\nRight now we decided to release just an Angular-SDK because our DAPP is Angular based, but feel free to take this as an inspiration to develop the SDK into any other framework you like.\nWhat's Hsuite?\nHsuite is an Hedera based technology, it makes uses of the power of Hedera to run the so called \"Smart Nodes\", which are a decentralised alternative to Smart Contract for Hedera Hashgraph.\nIf you want to know more about the project, check out the official links:\nWebsite |\nDocs\nfollow us on socials:\nTwitter |\nDiscord\nEvery single node of the network acts in a decentralised manner, so you can basically query each node and obtain the same identical response.\nWe provided also very basic swagger interface as well, which can be found under /api of every node, so for instance you will find the swagger for testnet nodes by following those links (those urls are just an example, you will find the same /api swagger interface on any of our network's nodes):\nTestnet - Smart Node 1 - APITestnet - Smart Node 2 - APITestnet - Smart Node 3 - APITestnet - Smart Node 4 - API\nInstallation\nIf you use npm, you shall run:\nnpm install @hsuite/smart-node-sdkinstead, if you use yarn:\nyarn add @hsuite/smart-node-sdkHow to Use the SDK\nInto your app.module.ts you should import our SDK and also provide the network you wish to work with, either 'testnet' | 'mainnet'.\nimport { SmartNodeSdkModule } from 'src/app/services/src/lib/smart-node-sdk.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [\n    SmartNodeSdkModule\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    { provide: 'network', useValue: 'mainnet'}\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\n\nexport class AppModule { }Then, you can use the SDK in your app.component.ts to setup the events listeners and the main behavior, like in this example:\nimport { SmartNodeSdkService } from '@hsuite/angular-sdk';\n\n// subscribing to webSockets authentication events...\nthis.smartNodeSdkService.getEventsObserver().subscribe(async(event) => {\n  switch(event.method) {\n    case 'authentication':\n      // this event will open an authenticate request on hashpack, you can\n      // use this event to show a loading spinner, or any other UI interaction...\n      break;\n    case 'authenticate':\n      // this event will let you know if the user signed the auth on hashpack,\n      // or either rejected it, so you can do your UI login in here...\n      break;\n    case 'events':\n      // those are generic events, so you can handle all your UI logic related to\n      // any of the feature you're interacting with (launchpad, dex, dao, etc)\n      break;\n    case 'error':\n      // those events will show you any error coming from your interaction with smart nodes\n      // you can use those events to show those error in your UI...\n      break;\n  }    \n});  \n\nthis.smartNodeSdkService.getHashPackService().observeHashpackConnection.subscribe(async(savedData) => {\n  // this observer will let your DAPP know any login/logout/connection events related to hashpack itself...\n});Services\nYou can interact with the SDK on a very high level, you don't need to interact with the websockets \nor the network services unless you're doing something very advanced.\nNodes will be validating the requested transaction, and sign it if all the validators checks approves it.\nSmartNodeSdkService\nThe easiest way to use this SDK is to interact only with the SmartNodeSdkService.\nThere are few methods to help you out interacting with the all underlying layer.\nThe EventsObserver will provide you an easy access to all events triggered by the SmartNode Network.\ngetEventsObserver()The NetworkService provides all the methods you might need in order to interact with the SmartNode Network on a lower level.\ngetNetworkService()The HashPackService is basically wrapping all the interactions with HashPask into an easy-to-use service, so to avoid any headacke. \ngetHashPackService()The RestService provides all the methods you need to interact with the SmartNode HTTP GET Methods (read-only)\ngetRestService()The SocketService handles all the websockets connections on a low level, keeping track of healthy nodes and providing an easy-to-handle interface.\ngetSocketsService()The HederaService offers some methods (like AssociateToken for example), to facilitate some interaction by wrapping the most common use cases.\ngetHederaService()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
